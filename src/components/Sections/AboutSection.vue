        When I was 16, I decided I would work in the video game industry. Since
        then, I've slowly and steadily been working on learning and improving my
        skills to be the best game developer I can be, while also exploring
        other areas of multimedia development. I have always enjoyed learning
        and facing new challenges, which has led me to gain some experience in
        lots of different areas.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-3">
        I enjoy working within a team environment. Seeing the combined effort we
        all make always motivates me to put out my best, and to achieve great
        results the whole team can enjoy. I'm an organized person and I usually
        end up taking on leadership roles within self-organized groups, being a
        communication bridge between team members and deciding and assigning
        tasks.
      </p>

      <p>
        Overall, I am driven by a deep-seated passion for creating games and
        thrive on the collaborative process. I am eager to contribute my skills
        and expertise to new and exciting projects.
