              This is the first published game I've been part of. In it, I've
              been able to experience and learn what it's like to work with
              multiple team members with different skill sets and roles. We were
              a total of 16 members and 2 producers.

              Features and Tasks I was in charge of
            </h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Final Boss:</b> This boss had 5 different attacks and 5
                different phases. These phases modified the behavior and the
                attacks he could perform, as well as the size and speed of some
                of them.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Performance Optimization:</b> I was in charge of measuring
                times and implementing solutions to performance problems, such
                as a custom system to load and unload some expensive actors
                during gameplay, or finding lumen parameters that increased the
                performance without sacrificing the visuals.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Custom Graphics Settings:</b> The default settings that
                Unreal gives by default treated the visuals very poorly on mid
                and low presets. So, I was in charge of finding which commands I
                needed to still lower the requirements while keeping it visually
                appealing.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Destructibles:</b> I dealt with Unreal's Chaos Physics to
                create objects that the player could break, like boxes or vases.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Non-Playable Character:</b> As a secondary task, the player
                can push a button to open the NPC cage and free him, which will
                trigger a dialogue and reward you with coins.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Coins and Pickups:</b> I made all the behavior of these coins
                which drop from enemies when hit, similarly to the 3D Sonic
                games.
              </li>

              Copperfield Engine is a 3D game engine created by just two people.
              It aims to offer the essential features for game development, with
              an easy-to-use API that follows a data-driven design with the use
              of ECS.

              The only libraries used are glfw, glew, imgui, tinyobjloader,
              StbImage and OpenAL. We have tried to keep them to a minimum,
              having our own math and collision library, as well as physics.
