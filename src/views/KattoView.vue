    <p>
      The game was developed using Unreal Engine 5 and programmed with C++.
      There are a few small functions and classes that were done with
      blueprints, which were mostly made towards the end of development when we
      needed to rush small details. We always kept in mind that whatever we
      coded should be as usable as possible for our designers and artists.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the development, aside from my assigned programming tasks, I played
      a leadership role, acting as a communication bridge between programmers
      and non-programmers. I also frequently found myself helping artists import
      and organize assets in the engine and with version control. Additionally,
      I assisted programmers with referencing and using functions and classes
      created by others.

  <SectionLayout p-title="Final Boss" p-data="Final Boss">
    <h3>Behaviour</h3>
    <p>
      The boss has 5 attacks: shots with his crossbow, hits on the ground that
      generate waves, a combo that mixes the previous two attacks, a tail swipe
      that hits if you are near, and a charge. This charge is the main attack,
      in which the boss will launch towards the player. If the player avoids it,
      the boss can crash into a pillar, which will stun him for a while. While
      stunned, the player can jump on him to deal damage and advance to the next
      phase.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each phase modifies the attacks that can be performed and sometimes the
      speed and size of them. The first phase is just a charge attack towards a
      pillar (used as a tutorial). The second only uses crossbow attacks, the
      third uses waves, the fourth uses combos, and the last uses all of the
      attacks with slight variations. At any point, a melee attack is performed
      if the player is near.
    </p>
    <h3 class="pt-4">Challenges</h3>
    <h4 class="challenge pt-0">Deadline-Driven Refactoring</h4>
    <p>
      At the beginning, all of the code for the boss, including internal
      variables and attacks, was in the same class. This was fine at the start,
      but most of the boss was completed in the last month of development.
    </p>
    <p>
      Given the time constraints, I needed to implement a solution quickly so
      that the designers could test and propose improvements before it was too
      late. but while doing so It was very common to add a simple feature and
      break something unrelated. As soon as I had a barely functional boss that
      the designers could test, I started refactoring and moving the code for
      each attack to an independent component. After that, I quickly returned to
      improving the functionality. the code was still far from perfect but it
      was enough to make the changes designers proposed comfortably and without
      introducing many new bugs.
    </p>
    <h4 class="challenge">Node-Based Phase Management</h4>
    <p>
      Initially, there was a single phase where the boss would simply lose
      health when hit. The phases were introduced, again, in the last month, so
      I had to come up with a system that allowed the designers to modify
      several variables depending on the phase.
    </p>
    <p>
      I achieved this by setting the variables through the nodes of the behavior
      tree instead of the character blueprint. Inside the behavior tree, I had
      one subtree for each phase, and the first node executed in each subtree
      was just to set variables. Aside from that node, each attack node had some
      variables to modify the specific attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm happy with how the system turned out, but it did lack the ability to
      set some variables for all the phases. Sometimes we wanted to change the
      charge speed for every phase and had to modify the 5 different nodes. I
      could have probably added a base node to set the variables and only set
      the phase nodes if the value was modified or added a tick to each variable
      to indicate when the values should be overridden.
    </p>
    <h4 class="challenge">The Wave Dilemma</h4>
    <p>
      Making this attack was pretty difficult. We came up with a good solution
      for the collision and logic, but for displaying it, we couldn't find a
      solution that didn't show visible seams or artifacts along the wave.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the collisions, I first thought of checking the distance between the
      player and the center of the wave, but that would be pretty hard to update
      and sync with the visible wave. But I realized, that since the wave only
      needed to collide with the player, I could just have a small box collider
      that moved along with the wave and rotated to always face the player's
      direction. And that worked like a charm.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the visuals, we discussed several options with the artists, such as
      having several small meshes spawn as the wave grows, which would make it
      hard to hide the spawning meshes. Another option was to have a growing
      texture on the ground, but the scaling of it would affect the width of the
      wave and thus the gameplay. We couldn't come to an agreement at first, so
      I started with a simple and functional solution, which was using 4 meshes
      deformed by a spline forming a circle. This had the problem that applied
      textures would either be stretched or create visible seams.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the end, the assets for the wave were constantly delayed and we didn't
      test many other solutions, so this solution stayed, and we ended up with
      visible seams on the wave.

  <SectionLayout p-title="Destructible objects" p-data="Destuctibles">
    <h3>Behaviour</h3>
    <p>
      For the game, we needed to have objects that like boxes, vases and
      pillars, tht broke when the player or boss crashed with them. I was done
      using the Unreal Chaos Physics.
    </p>
    <h3>Challenges</h3>
    <h4 class="challenge">Deactivating Debris Collisions</h4>
    <p>
      We wanted the debris of these objects to ignore the collisions with the
      player, but the object should block the player while it wasn't broken. For
      some reason, Geometry Collections (the breakable objects) didn't allow
      changing the collision channel during runtime.
    </p>
    <p>
      To solve this issue, I created a class that included both the Geometry
      Collection and a static mesh. When the game started, the static mesh,
      which collides with the player, would be used. However, when the object
      needed to be destroyed, the static mesh would be deactivated, and the
      Geometry Collection, which doesn't collide with the player, would be made
      visible and broken.
    </p>
    <h4 class="challenge">The Elusive Build-Only Bug</h4>
    <p>
      The boxes needed to have physics enabled, and there wasn't a problem with
      it until, at some point, a month after it was done, we realized that only
      in builds, the boxes would stay floating, and the physics wouldn't
      activate until something touched them.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was a very difficult and tedious problem to solve. In previous
      instances of mysterious bugs that started occurring suddenly only in
      builds, I tried to debug a build or use version control to identify which
      commit introduced the bug. However, in this case, that didn't work. The
      debugging showed that the physics were indeed activated, and the bug was
      introduced too long ago to be traced. I blindly started making small
      changes that might have had a slight possibility of fixing the issue, but
      none of them worked. In the end, after going through the Unreal forums, I
      found that there seemed to be a bug in the version we were working on.
      Manually executing a command to disable physics sleep when the game
      started solved the issue.

  <SectionLayout p-title="Optimizations" p-data="Optimizations">
    <h4 class="challenge">Loading and Unloading Levels</h4>
    <p>
      We were using world composition in Unreal, but there were reasons why we
      didn't want to use level streaming to unload complete sections of the
      maps. First, our maps had several places where the final part of the level
      could be seen from the beginning. Aside from that, we also had problems
      with objects using physics and checkpoints. For physics, if the ground or
      boxes disappeared, they would have to be repositioned. The checkpoints
      were problematic because they were just used to teleport the player, and
      if the ground at the teleport location wasn't loaded, the character would
      fall into the void.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because of all these reasons, we created our own loading and unloading
      system that only included the consuming elements in the game, like coins,
      enemies, particles, and similar items. The first attempt we tried was to
      have a load and unload trigger for each sub-level, but that still had some
      of the same problems we were trying to avoid. It was also really hard to
      set up and very prone to bugs.
    </p>
    <p>
      After 4 hours of trying to set up that system on the first level, I came
      up with a different method. Instead of using triggers, we used a large
      volume and loaded and unloaded elements when entering or exiting the
      volume. Additionally, instead of the volume having references to all the
      objects it had to activate and deactivate, the objects held a reference to
      the volume. This way, we could force the system to be used by the
      designers and artists, helping to avoid bugs. This method solved all the
      problems we had. It still wasn't easy to set up, but it was much easier
      than the previous approach.
    </p>
    <h4 class="challenge">Optimizing Lumen</h4>
    <p>
      Towards the end of development, we started testing the game on different
      computers, and it only worked properly on very high-end PCs. So, I was in
      charge of fixing it. The initial analysis showed that our main problem was
      with the GPU thread, specifically related to Lumen and anti-aliasing. We
      also had a lot of draw calls and many tris to render. We asked the artists
      to create more instances, adjust the meshes' Level of Detail, and reduce
      texture resolutions, hoping that would mitigate the issue. In the end, we
      used Nanite, but even though we had drastically reduced the draw calls and
      tris, it didn't improve performance because those changes didn't address
      the bottleneck.
    </p>
    <p>
      To fix this, I started looking into which Lumen options could be modified
      without affecting the game's visual quality. There wasn't much, but I
      found that we could use Screen Space Reflections instead of Lumen
      Reflections. This change made a noticeable visual difference but
      significantly improved performance. After discussing with the artists, we
      agreed that Screen Space Reflections suited our visual style better, so
      there was no downside to disabling Lumen reflections. Aside from that,
      there wasn't much more to do, so the only option left was to use the
      scalability settings.
    </p>
    <p>
      We already had a settings menu, but it was created in the early stages and
      didn't include options for global illumination, shadows, and resolution
      scale, which were the most relevant settings. After adding these options,
      setting them to medium made the game look poor, as it completely
      deactivated Lumen. So, I created custom scalability settings to try to
      retain essential features like shadows, Lumen, and anti-aliasing even on
      low settings while reducing other parameters to still improve performance.

  <SectionLayout p-title="Pickups and Coins" p-data="Pickups">
    <h3>Behaviour</h3>
    <p>
      Every enemy or character can drop coins or a power-up. These are thrown in
      a circle and will bounce using physics, similar to Sonic 3D games. The
      coins also have an area where they are pulled towards the player. There is
      a special kind of flying enemy, when they are killed, after of dropping
      the coins, these are pulled towards the player, no matter how far they
      are.
    </p>
    <h4 class="challenge">Projectile Move Component vs Physics</h4>
    <p>
      When implementing the coin drop, I initially used physics, but I couldn't
      achieve consistent results with it. Even when applying the same force to
      all the coins, they wouldn't cover the same distance and would bounce
      slightly differently from one another. To fix this, I tested using a
      Projectile Movement Component, which is a simplified physics system, and
      that worked perfectly.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was concerned that the Projectile Movement Component might make it
      difficult to achieve other effects, so I kept the physics-based coins for
      a while. And in fact, there was a problem with the pool system that made
      me consider returning to using physics.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm still not sure why, but deactivating the component would sometimes
      cause it to lose the reference to the object it should be moving. Knowing
      that, resetting the reference fixed the problem, finding the issue took
      quite a while, as it didn't crash the game and seemingly at random, most
      coins would just stop moving.
    </p>
  </SectionLayout>
  <SectionLayout p-title="NPC" p-data="PickNPCups">
    <p>
      The NPC is caged in each level, and the player has to push a button to
      open the cage. Then, when near him, a dialogue will start, and he will
      drop some coins. The only difficulties encountered were with the
      animations, as the character had to look at the player while performing
      some of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      To make the NPC look at the player, using only the neck bone for movement
      looked unnatural. So, I also rotated a spine bone to aim halfway. With
      these two rotation points, the animation looked much more natural. I also
      had to create a transition for the rotation to prevent it from snapping
      when switching to an animation where the NPC didn't need to look at the
      player.
