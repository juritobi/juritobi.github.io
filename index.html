                <h2>Videogame programmer</h2>
                <p>Programming and videogames are my biggets passions, why not mix them?</p>
                <p>I love low level programming and and understanding the deepest parts of the code I write, but overall I love learning. 
                I still have a long way to go with my skills, but I'm really passionate about it and willing to keep moving forward in my carrer as a game developer</p>
                <p>I'm a fast learner, really patient and great at working with others. those skills have allowed me and my colleges to make a couple of games for amstrad CPC and a C++ game with our own engine.
                    I'm also a very logical and analytic person, and a har worker (considdering programming was a job for me :P).
