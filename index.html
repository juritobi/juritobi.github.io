                <h2>Videogame programmer</h2>
                <h5>Programming and videogames are my biggets passions, why not mix them?</h5>
                <p>I love low level programming and and understanding the deepest parts of the code I write, but overall
                    I love learning.
                    I still have a long way to go with my skills, but I'm really passionate about it and willing to keep
                    moving forward in my carrer as a game developer</p>
                <p>I'm a fast learner, really patient and great at working with others. those skills have allowed me and
                    my colleges to make a couple of games for amstrad CPC and a C++ game with our own engine.
                    I'm also a very logical and analytic person, and a har worker (considdering programming was a job
                    for me :P).

                <h2>C game for Amstrad CPC</h2>
                <p>hobby proyect made with a college, it took us 5 weeks to develop and was presented to the CPCRetrodev
                    contest, cualifying 12th out of 49 games</p>
                <p>it was programmed in C but it reaquired knwoledge of assembly code to debug and optimize the game,
                    and becaouse of the limited memory space and computing power, opmizing was a big part of the
                    development</p>
                <p>the game is an action plataformer, where the player has to find 4 specific rooms to open the gate to
                    the final boss, we were trying to make a game similar to rogue legacy, with the obious limitation of
                    an amstrad CPC</p>
