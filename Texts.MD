# Copperfield Engine
Copperfield Engine is a 3D game engine created by just two people. It aims to offer the essential features for game development, with an easy-to-use API that follows a data-driven design using ECS.

The only libraries used are GLFW, GLEW, ImGui, TinyObjLoader, stb_image, and OpenAL. We have tried to keep them to a minimum, having our own math and collision library, as well as physics.

### Features I've worked on
 - Entity Component System
 - Multi-threaded asset loading
 - Forward and Deferred Rendering
 - Action-based input
 - Shadow Mapping
 - Physics and collisions
